# RollerBall
This project builds on the roll a ball game tutorial available on the Unity website. The tutorial involves creating a game world in which the player uses the arrow keys on the keyboard to roll a ball around in order to collect pickups.

Personal additions so far include:

Bounce physics
Main Menu
Victory screen
Pause menu with restart, main menu and exit functionality
